# C++ Numerics and Visualization

Mixing in standard Python numerics with C++ bindings and C++ visualizations for efficiency.

## Dependencies
- [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [Eigen3](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
- [Matplot++](https://github.com/alandefreitas/matplotplusplus)
- [Boost](https://www.boost.org)
- [xtensor](https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xtensor)

For system-wide accessibility on Mac, some of these packages can be downloaded with brew and included with CMAKE:
```
brew install pybind11 matplot++ boost xtensor
```

## Quick Start

```
# Build the CMAKE project:
~/cppviz $ mkdir build
~/cppviz $ cd build
~/cppviz/build $ cmake ..
~/cppviz/build $ make

# or with the included Makefile:
~/cppviz $ make build

# To use CCLS language server (n/vim), use CMAKE to create a compile_commands.json:
cmake -H. -BDebug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=YES
ln -s Debug/compile_commands.json .

# or with the included Makefile
make debug
```

## Project Structure

```
# CMakeLists.txt should link all relevant libraries necessary to the current
# subdirectory's files
cppviz/
|-- apps/
|   |-- # executable files here
|-- src/
|   |-- # source files
|-- include/cpp_viz/
|             |-- # Header file for signatures and includes
|-- tests/
|   |-- # Write tests with Catch2 for source files here
|-- build/
    |-- # Generated by CMAKE with executables and logs
```
